Using the HTML5 File API, we open a handle on the file\n     5. Read the filename for later display to the user\n     6. Create a hidden Image element in the browser's DOM\n     7. Read the file's bytes as a DataUrl and copy them into the Image element\n     8. Wait until the Image finishes loading the image\n     9. Read the image element's natural width and height\n     10. Pass the File handle into a HTML5 Canvas lib (we need the XIFF headers to auto rotate, XIFF headers are not available in DataUrl)\n     11. The Canvas errors because it's a wrong type, e.g., TIFF, we abort and notify user\n     12. Instruct the Canvas lib to keep resizing the image if it exceeds a maximum width or height,\n     extract meta data, and auto-orient based on XIFF metadata.  It uses a \"contain\" operation which retains\n     it's width to height pixel ratio.\n     13. Call a function on the Canvas element to turn the Canvas into a JPEG of quality 50%.\n     14. Once in a Blob with get the blob size in bytes and a human friendly display size\n     15. In order to more easily manage the image, we convert the Blob to a DataUrl again.\n     16. Pass the DataUrl into a hash algorithm to create an identifier and to check if the image has already been uploaded\n     17. Next we check the final size of the image to ensure it's not to small in resolution\n     (arguably this could've been done earlier), if too small we notify user\n     18. Finally, the image is saved into the user's ongoing EA/PA application including localstorage\n     19. The image is displayed to user as a thumbnail\n\n     */\n\n    ngOnInit(): void {\n\n\n        const dragOverStream =\n            fromEvent(this.dropZone.nativeElement, 'dragover');\n\n        /**\n         * Must cancel the dragover event in order for the drop event to work.\n         */\n        dragOverStream.pipe(map(evt => {\n            return event;\n        })).subscribe(evt => {\n            // console.log('Cancel dragover event.');\n            evt.preventDefault();\n        });\n\n        const dropStream = fromEvent(this.dropZone.nativeElement, 'drop');\n        const filesArrayFromDrop = dropStream.pipe(\n            map(\n                function (event) {\n                    event.preventDefault();\n                    return event.dataTransfer.files;\n                }\n            ));\n\n        const browseFileStream = fromEvent(this.browseFileRef.nativeElement, 'change');\n        // const captureFileStream = fromEvent(this.captureFileRef.nativeElement, 'change');\n\n        merge(merge(browseFileStream).pipe(\n            map(\n                (event) => {\n                    event.preventDefault();\n                    return event.target['files'];\n\n                }\n            )),\n            filesArrayFromDrop).pipe(\n                filter(files => {\n                    console.log('files');\n                    return !!files && files.length && files.length > 0;\n                }),\n                flatMap(\n                    (fileList: FileList) => {\n\n                        return this.observableFromFiles(fileList, new CommonImageScaleFactorsImpl(1, 1));\n                    }\n                ),\n                filter(\n                    (mspImage: CommonImage) => {\n\n                        const imageExists = FileUploaderComponent.checkImageExists(mspImage, this.images);\n                        if (imageExists) {\n                            this.handleError(CommonImageError.AlreadyExists, mspImage);\n                            this.resetInputFields();\n                        }\n                        return !imageExists;\n                    }\n                ),\n                // TODO - Is this necessary?

SharedCoreModule.\nimport { SharedCoreModule } from 'moh-common-lib';\n\n\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [ ... ],\n    providers: [ ... ],\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        SharedCoreModule\n    ]\n})By adding this module you will automatically get access to core components, each starting with  \"common-*\". View all components\nThis does not import Services, Models, and some specific components like FileUploader and Captcha. Those will be detailed below.\nImporting Dos and Don'ts\nAll imports from moh-common-lib should go to one of the secondary entry points listed above (e.g. /models or /captcha). You should never import from a deeper level. When auto-importing make sure to double-check the import paths because VS Code often likes to setup incorrect imports.\n// GOOD\nimport { GeocoderService } from 'moh-common-lib/services';\n\n// BAD\nimport { GeoAddressResult } from 'moh-common-lib/services/geocoder.service';If you need access to an export and can only get it this way, let us know and we can export it properly.\nImporting a Service (moh-common-lib/services)\nIf a service is usable as-is, you can find them in the Injectables section of the documentation in the menu.\nimport { GeocoderService } from 'moh-common-lib/services';Setting up an API Service (moh-common-lib/services)\nIn some cases, we provide abstract classes that provide the foundation of services you will create.   \nFor example, the AbstractHTTPService:\nimport { AbstractHttpService } from 'moh-common-lib/services';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class APIService extends AbstractHTTPService {}\n// You will have to setup _headers, and handleError(), \n// and create your own methods for each API Request using this.get() and this.post()These Abstract classes are not injectables and as such are found under Classes.  The Classes folder section also includes other non-service classes, like models.\nImporting a Model (moh-common-lib/models)\nModels are all found under Classes.\nimport { Address } from 'moh-common-lib/models';\nconst addr = new Address();The address, and others like it, is a pure TypeScript model with no specific Angular integration. However, other components may expect an Address as an @Input.\nFile Uploader classes, interfaces, etc. (moh-common-lib/images)\nAll classes, interfaces, and enums related to the FileUploader are all in moh-common-lib/images\nimport { CommonImage, CommonImageError, CommonImageScaleFactorsImpl } from 'moh-common-lib/images';This does NOT include the actual FileUploader, which is currently in the SharedCoreModule.\nCAPTCHA\nNote: This is still in development and may not be working\nimport { CaptchaModule } from 'moh-common-lib/captcha';\n\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [ ... ],\n    providers: [ ... ],\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        CaptchaModule\n    ]\n})Then register your application module and use \n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/local-development.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/local-development.html","title":"additional-page - Local Development","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Development\n\ncomponents\nschematics\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/local-development/schematics.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/local-development/schematics.html","title":"additional-page - Schematics","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematics\nThis file will help you get setup with building and running schematics. This is not necessary for publishing NPM builds of components, but is relevant if you wish to use these schematics for code-generation.\nWriting code & compiling changes\nMake sure to write all changes to .ts files, e.g. index.ts.   The schematics folder, and all schemtaics, must be in projects/common/schematics\n    npm run build # compiles one time - must be run in schematics folder\n    npm run build -- -w # watches for changes and re-compiles - in schematics folder\n    npm run build:schematics # helper command - can be run anywhere in project, even top levelThen use the above to compile to .d.ts, .js, and .map.js files. It's important to compile the files before running any schematics either locally or before publishing to npm, etc. \nUnsure: Potentially you may need to run npm install prior to your first build.\nLinking Schematics\nLinking schematics only has to be done once. You'll only have to do it again if you move this folder.\nWe have to link from the projects/common/schematics folder. You can tell it's the correct folder because it has package.json in it.\n    cd moh-common-styles/projects/common/schematics\n    npm link # creates moh-common-schematics link, name from package.jsonCreating a new project and running schematics\n    ng new example --style=scss --routing=true // both params required\n    npm link moh-common-schematics # creates a symlink to the schematics folder above\n    ng g moh-common-schematics:moh-start # runs the schematicCreating a new schematic\nFirst, you must make sure the schematics-cli is installed on your machine.\n    npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cliTo create a new schematic, make sure to run the command from the right folder.  It should be in the same folder as the moh-common-schematics package.json. projects/common/schematics\n    cd projects/common/schematics\n    schematics blank  --name=schematic-name-exampleTODO\n\n ~~*High Priority Fix compilation errors when lodaing moh-common-lib (WizardProgressBar) in moh-start by adding to tsconfig:*~~ [2019-03-06]\n  \"typeRoots\": [ \"../node_modules/@types\" ],\n  \"skipLibCheck\": true\n Making changes to schematic + re-compiling (npm run build + watch command)\n\n Include integration with upcoming moh-common-styles library\n\n resolve issue with component viewProviders, ControlContainer + ngForms for \"nested\" components\n\n uncomment pollyfills.ts\n\n Package.json scripts from fpc (e.g. version, preversion)\n\n Document need for openshift/ folder to still be manually setup\n\n Configurable project name, e.g. change page title.\n\n Split moh-start schematic into multiple schematics, de-compose them. Will make path to future 'update' calls simpler (update-scss, update-assets, update-dependencies). Moh-start should just call each of them.\n\n Convert moh-start to use templates instead of base64 encoding (like version-js does)\n\n Add momentjs as dependency to package.json\n\n Add NgForm and other modules to appropriate angular modules\n\n angular.json - add preserveSymlinks to new projects\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/local-development/components.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/local-development/components.html","title":"additional-page - Components","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nThis file will help you get setup with local development for components, modules, and other importable objects. This includes local builds, but it is also a required step in order to create builds for NPM.\nThis does not include schematics which are not imported by projects but rather ran on them or used to generate code. \nNew Project Setup + Schematics\nThis project has 2 main parts to it, and this readme is broken in 2 to reflect that.\n\nThe Library - moh-common-lib - relates to this project as a component library for an Angular application, to appear in the node_modules/ folder of an Angular application\nThe Schematics - moh-common-schematics - relates to this project as a collection of Angular schematics and scripts to setup a whole project or files within a project. These schematics live in this project, but operate on an Angular application.\n\nThere are two different npm links for each of these facets.  Each one corresponds to a different package.json:\n\nmoh-common-lib (library) > projects/common/package.json\nmoh-common-schematics (schematics) > projects/common/schematics/package.json\n\nFor more information on schematics, look at the Schematics documentation.\nThe Library\nBuilding the Library\nFirst make sure to run npm install prior to building, to install necessary dependencies.  You must build the library prior to using and linking in local development.\n> ng build moh-commmon-libIf it runs well, the end of the output should show the following:\nBuilt moh-common-lib\nBuilt Angular Package!\n- from: /space/workspace/moh-common-styles/projects/common\n- to:   /space/workspace/moh-common-styles/dist/commonWe can see build artifacts are created in the \"to\" folder. For local development, we will npm link directly to that folder; when publishing to npm we will publish tohse artifacts.\nSetting up npm link for library\nOh the command line navigate to the \"to\" folder from above, the dist folder for the common project: moh-common-styles/dist/common. Then run the following command:\n> npm linkNote - the dist/common folder MUST have a package.json in it. The name in the package.json will be used as a reference when linking to this folder from other folders (e.g. when configuring PRIME to use this common library). In our case the name is moh-common-lib. Assuming all goes well you should see output at the end like this (paths may differ):\n.../example/path.../node/v8.9.4/lib/node_modules/moh-common-lib -> /space/workspace/moh-common-styles/projects/common\nIf the folder does not exist, or is empty, make sure to build the library.\nSetting up npm link for library\nYou must make sure to set \"preserveSymlinks\": true in angular.json under the project>architect>build>options.\nThen navigate to the application which will consume the library, make sure you're in the same folder as that application's package.json (this should be the top level, e.g. prime-web/).  From there, run npm link moh-common-lib.  That's it, the build artifacts from the library will now appear in node_modules/ and can be imported like any other library.  Now in the application you can write...\nTypeScript\nimport { example } from 'moh-common-lib'\nIf you've made any chanfges to the library make sure to re-build with ng build moh-commmon-lib from the library folder.\nAs for what specifically you can import from 'moh-common-lib', that is all defined in projects/common/src/public_api.ts.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
